### Get a new Alibaba account or get assigned to existing account

---

If there is no account you can get assigned to, create an [SOS ticket](https://sostool.wdf.sap.corp/start.aspx) for an Alibaba account.

If there is already an account (we currently use account [1096122013536219.onaliyun.com](http://1096122013536219.onaliyun.com/)), request your user to be added to this account: Create a Jira ticket to Multi Cloud for user management requests - [https://jira.multicloud.int.sap/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2/create/600](https://jira.multicloud.int.sap/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2/create/600)

* add comment that user should also have admin permissions, in my case a user without any permission was created

Wait for completion notification by mail containing username and password

URL for logon: * [https://signin.aliyun.com/login.htm](https://signin.aliyun.com/login.htm)*

Setup TFA

If user has no permissions at all, open multicloud ticket and request admin permission for this account,

[hristo.raykov@sap.com](mailto:hristo.raykov@sap.com) needs to approve this request
